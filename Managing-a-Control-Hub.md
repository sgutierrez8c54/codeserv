### Changing Its Name
By default, the Control Hub has a name that begins with the phrase "FTC-" and ends with four characters that are assigned at the factory.  In order to comply with game manual rule \<RS01\>, the name should be changed.

You can change the name of a Control Hub using a laptop or Chromebook that is connected to the Hub's Program & Management page.

**Important Note:** Changing the name of a Control Hub changes the name of the Hub's wireless network.  Once the name is changed, you will have to reconnect your devices (Driver Station and programming laptop/Chromebook) to the new network.
