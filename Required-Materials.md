This wiki contains tutorials that demonstrate how to configure, program, and operate the FTC control system.  In order to complete the tutorials, you will need to have the following materials available: 

| Required Item(s) | Image |
| ----------- | :---: |
| Two (2) _FIRST_-approved* Android smartphones. <br/><br/> <p align="center">Or...</p>  One (1) Control Hub and one (1) _FIRST_-approved* Android smartphone.<br/><br/><sub><sup>***For a list of _FIRST_-approved Android smartphones, refer to the current FTC Game Manual Part 1, rule \<RE06\>.**</sub></sup> | [[/images/Required-Materials/twoAndroidPhones.jpg]] <br/><br/>Or... <br/><br/> [[/images/Required-Materials/ControlHubAndPhone.jpg]]|
| A Google account (available for free from Google) to access the Google Play store. | [[/images/Required-Materials/GoogleAccount.jpg]] |
| Wireless Internet access. | [[/images/Required-Materials/WiFiSymbol.jpg]] |
| Laptop with Microsoft Windows 7, 8 or 10 and Wi-Fi capability.<br/><br/>Note that your laptop should have the most current <br/>service packs and system updates from Microsoft.<br/><br/>If you are using a different type of machine (such as a <br/>Chromebook, Android Tablet, etc.) as your programming <br/>device, the steps might differ slightly on how to access <br/>the Programming Server on the Robot Controller. Refer <br/>to your device's user documentation for details on how <br/>to connect to a Wi-Fi network. | [[/images/Required-Materials/Laptop.jpg]] |
| Javascript-enabled web browser (Google Chrome is the <br/>recommended browser). | [[/images/Required-Materials/ChromeBrowser.jpg]] |
| If you are using a smartphone as your Robot Controller, <br/>you will also need a REV Robotics Expansion Hub <br/>(REV-31-1153) to connect to the motors, servos, <br/>and sensors. Control Hub users will use the integrated <br/>Expansion Hub. | [[/images/Required-Materials/ExpansionHub.jpg]] |
| REV Robotics Switch, Cable, & Bracket (REV-31-1387). | [[/images/Required-Materials/REVSwitch.jpg]] |
| If you are using an approved 12V battery that has an Tamiya <br/>connector (like the Tetrix W39057 battery) you will need a <br/>REV Robotics Tamiya to XT30 Adapter Cable (REV-31-1382). <br/><br/>If you have a REV Robotics Slim Battery (REV-31-1302) then <br/>you will not need this adapter since the REV battery <br/>already has an XT30 connector. | [[/images/Required-Materials/TamiyaAdapter.jpg]] |
| _FIRST_-approved* 12V Battery (such as Tetrix W39057 or <br/>REV Robotics REV-31-1302).<br/><br/><sub><sup>***For a list of _FIRST_-approved 12V batteries, refer to the current FTC Game Manual Part 1, rule \<RE03\>.**</sub></sup> | [[/images/Required-Materials/Battery.jpg]] <br/><br/>Or... <br/><br/> [[/images/Required-Materials/REVSlimBattery.jpg]]|
| _FIRST_-approved* 12V DC Motor (such as Tetrix W39530, <br/>with power cable W41352). <br/><br/><sub><sup>***For a list of _FIRST_-approved 12V motors, refer to the current FTC Game Manual Part 1, rule \<RE09\>.**</sub></sup>  | [[/images/Required-Materials/MotorAndCable.jpg]] |
| REV Robotics Anderson to JST VH Cable (REV-31-1381).  | [[/images/Required-Materials/AndersonToJST.jpg]] |
| 180-Degree Standard Scale Servo (such as <br/>Hitec HS-485HB). | [[/images/Required-Materials/HitecServo.jpg]] |
| REV Robotics Color Sensor with 4-Pin Cable <br/>(REV-31-1154). | [[/images/Required-Materials/REVColorSensor.jpg]] |
| REV Robotics Touch Sensor with 4-Pin Cable <br/>(REV-31-1425). | [[/images/Required-Materials/REVTouchSensor.jpg]] |
| If you are using a smartphone as your Robot Controller, <br/>you will need a USB Type A male to type mini-B male cable. <br/><br/>Control Hub users do not need this cable. | [[/images/Required-Materials/USBTypeACable.jpg]] |
|  If you are using a smartphone as your Robot Controller, <br/>you will need two (2) micro USB OTG adapters. <br/><br/>If you are using a Control Hub as your Robot Controller, <br/>you will need one (1) micro USB OTG adapter. | [[/images/Required-Materials/OTGAdapter.jpg]] [[/images/Required-Materials/OTGAdapter.jpg]]|
| Logitech F310 USB Gamepad. | [[/images/Required-Materials/LogitechF310.jpg]] |
