### Changing the Name
In order to comply with game manual rule \<RS01\>, the name of the Robot Controller's smartphone should be changed.

[This tutorial](Configuring-Your-Android-Devices#renaming-your-smartphones) demonstrates how to rename a smartphone using the Android Settings activity of the phone.

You can also use the FTC app to change the Robot Controller phone's name.

**Important Note:** Once the name of your Robot Controller is changed, you might need to reconnect your devices (Driver Station and programming laptop/Chromebook) to the newly changed network.

If you use the FTC Blocks Development Tool or the FTC OnBot Java Tool to write your op modes, then the easiest way to update the Robot Controller App is using the Google Play store.  To be able to use the Google Play Store to update your software, you will first need the following items:
1.	A Google e-mail account (available for free from Google).
2.	Access to a wireless network that can connect to the Internet.
3.	Your Android smartphone.

**Important Note:** If you update your Robot Controller, then you should also update your Driver Station software to the same version number.

**Important Note:** if you are an Android Studio user, then you cannot use the Google Play Store to update your Robot Controller app.  Instead, by updating to the newest version of the FTC Android Studio project folder, you will update the Robot Controller app when you build the project and install it on your smartphone.  For the Skystone season, you can download the newest version of the project folder [here](https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/SkyStone).
