### What Needs to Be Configured for My Robot?
#### Control Hub Users

Teams who are using a Control Hub as the Robot Controller will only need to configure a single smartphone for use as a Driver Station.  The process is as follows,
* Rename the smartphone to "\<TEAM NUMBER\>-DS" (where \<TEAM NUMBER\> is replaced by your team number).
* Install the Driver Station app onto the Driver Station phone.
* Put your phone into Airplane Mode (with the WiFi radio still on).
* Pair (i.e., wirelessly connect) the Driver Station to the Control Hub.

#### Users with Two Android Smartphones
Teams who have two smartphones and are not using a Control Hub will need to configure one smartphone for use as a Robot Controller and a second smartphone for use as a Driver Station.  The process is as follows,
* Rename one smartphone to "\<TEAM NUMBER\>-RC" (where \<TEAM NUMBER\> is replaced by your team number).
* Install the Robot Controller app onto the Robot Controller phone.
* Rename a second smartphone to "\<TEAM NUMBER\>-DS" (where \<TEAM NUMBER\> is replaced by your team number).
* Install the Driver Station app onto the Driver Station phone.
* Put your phones into Airplane Mode (with the WiFi radios still on).
* Pair (i.e., wirelessly connect) the Driver Station to the Robot Controller.

### Renaming Your Smartphones
The official rules of the FIRST Tech Challenge (see \<RS01\>) require that you change the Wi-Fi name of your smartphones to include your team number and “-RC” if the phone is a Robot Controller or “-DS” if it is a Driver Station.  A team can insert an additional dash and a letter (“A”, “B”, “C”, etc.) if the team has more than one set of Android phones.

If, for example, a team has a team number of 9999 and the team has multiple sets of phones, the team might decide to name one phone “9999-C-RC” for the Robot Controller and the other phone “9999-C-DS” for the Driver Station.  The “-C” indicates that these devices belong to the third set of phones for this team.

Note that it will take an estimated 5 minutes per phone to complete this task.

### Installing the FTC Apps
The FTC apps are available to download for free from the Google Play store.  You will need to have your Android phones connected to a Wi-Fi network that has Internet access before you can access the Google Play store.  You will also need a Google account to be able to download the apps from the Google Play store.

It is also possible to "side-load" the FTC Android Apps onto the Robot Controller and Driver Station phones.  The GitHub repository contains the release versions of the Android apps:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;https://github.com/ftctechnh/ftc_app/tree/master/doc/apk

However, this section of the wiki does **not** include instructions on how to side-load the apps.  It only explains how to use Google Play to install the FTC apps.

Note that it will take an estimated 7.5 minutes per phone to complete this task.

| Step| Image |
| ----------- | :---: |
| 1. From the Android Wi-Fi screen look for the name of <br/>your wireless network (“CE_NET” in this example) and <br/>touch the wireless network name to login to the network.  | <img src="https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/WikiSupport/blob/master/ftc_app/images/InstallStep1.jpg" width="175"> |
| 2. Specify the password using the touch keypad and hit <br/>CONNECT to connect to this wireless network. | <img src="https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/WikiSupport/blob/master/ftc_app/images/InstallStep2.jpg" width="175"> |
| 3. Find the Google Play Store icon on your phone and <br/>click it to launch the Google Play Store app. | <img src="https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/WikiSupport/blob/master/ftc_app/images/InstallStep3.jpg" width="175"> |
| 4. If you haven’t signed into your Google account yet, <br/>follow the onscreen instructions to log into your <br/>Google account. <br/><br/>If you don’t have a Google account, follow the onscreen <br/>instructions create a new account. | <img src="https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/WikiSupport/blob/master/ftc_app/images/InstallStep4.jpg" width="175"> |
| 5. In the search window of the Google Play app, <br/>type in the words “FTC Robot Controller” to find the <br/>Robot Controller or “FTC Driver Station” to find the <br/>appropriate FTC app for your phone. | <img src="https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/WikiSupport/blob/master/ftc_app/images/InstallStep5.jpg" width="175"> |
| 6. Tap on the app in the Google Play listing to bring <br/>up the installation screen.  Follow the onscreen <br/>instructions to install the appropriate app for your phone.<br/><br/>**Important note:** When you install the FTC apps, **_only install <br/>one FTC app_** (FTC Robot Controller or FTC Driver Station) **_per <br/>phone._**<br/><br/>You should avoid installing both apps onto the same phone. <br/>Doing so can cause Wi-Fi connection problems.  You should <br/>only install the FTC Robot Controller app onto the phone <br/>that will be the Robot Controller and the FTC Driver Station <br/>app onto the phone that will be the Driver Station. | <img src="https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/WikiSupport/blob/master/ftc_app/images/InstallStep6.jpg" width="175"> |
| 7. After you have successfully installed the app, you should<br/>forget the external wireless network on your phone.<br/><br/>Go to the Android Wi-Fi screen, find the name of the <br/>currently connected network, and tap on the network name <br/>to bring up a pop-up box with info about the network. | <img src="https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/WikiSupport/blob/master/ftc_app/images/InstallStep7.jpg" width="175"> |
| 8. Click on the **FORGET** button to forget the wireless network. | <img src="https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/WikiSupport/blob/master/ftc_app/images/InstallStep8.jpg" width="175"> |

### Placing Phones into Airplane Mode with Wi-Fi On
For the FIRST Tech Challenge competitions, it is important that you place your Robot Controller and Driver Station phones into Airplane mode but keep their Wi-Fi radios turned on.  This is important because you do not want any of the cellular telephone functions to be enabled during a match.  The cellular telephone functions could disrupt the function of the robot during a match.

Note that it will take an estimated 2.5 minutes per phone to complete this task.  Also note that the screens displayed on your Android devices might differ slightly from the images contained in this wiki.

| Step| Image |
| ----------- | :---: |
| 1. On the main Android screen of each smartphone, use <br/>your finger to slide from the top of the screen down <br/>towards the bottom of the screen to display the quick <br/>configuration screen.<br/><br/>Note that for some smartphones you might have to swipe <br/>down more than once to display the quick configuration <br/>screen, particularly if there are messages or notifications <br/>displayed at the top of your screen.<br/><br/>Look for the Airplane mode icon (which is shaped like an <br/>airplane) and if the icon is not activated, touch the icon <br/>to put the phone into airplane mode. | <img src="https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/WikiSupport/blob/master/ftc_app/images/AirplaneStep1.jpg" width="175"> |
| 2. Placing the phone into airplane mode will turn off <br/>the Wi-Fi radio.  If the Wi-Fi icon has a diagonal line <br/>through it (see Step 1 above), then the Wi-Fi radio is <br/>disabled.  You will need to touch the “Wi-Fi” icon on the <br/>quick configuration screen to turn the Wi-Fi radio back <br/>on. | <img src="https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/WikiSupport/blob/master/ftc_app/images/AirplaneStep2.jpg" width="175"> |

### Pairing the Driver Station to the Robot Controller
#### Control Hub Users
The REV Robotics Control Hub should come with the Robot Controller app already pre-installed.  Once you have successfully installed the FTC Driver Station on an Android phone, you will want to establish a secure wireless connection between the Control Hub and the Driver Station.  This connection will allow your Driver Station phone to select op modes on your Robot Controller and send gamepad input to these programs.  Likewise, it will allow your op modes running on your Robot Controller to send telemetry data to your Driver Station phone where it can be displayed for your drivers. The process to connect the two devices is known as “pairing.”

Note that the Control Hub does not have its own internal battery.  Before you can connect a Driver Station to the Control Hub, you must connect the Control Hub to a 12V battery.

Note that it will take an estimated 10 minutes to complete this task.

| Step| Image |
| ----------- | :---: |
| 1. Connect an approved 12V battery to the power switch <br/>(REV-31-1387) and make sure the switch is in the off position.  <br/>Connect the switch to an XT30 port on the Control Hub <br/>and turn the switch on. <br/><br/>The LED should initially be blue on the Control Hub. | <img src="https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/WikiSupport/blob/master/ftc_app/images/PairingControlHubStep1.jpg" width="350"> |
| 2. It takes approximately 40 seconds for the Control Hub to power on. <br/>The Control Hub is ready to pair with the <br/>Driver Station when the LED turns green. <br/><br/>Note: the light blinks blue every ~5 seconds to indicate that the Control Hub is healthy. | <img src="https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/WikiSupport/blob/master/ftc_app/images/PairingControlHubStep2.jpg" width="250"> |
| 3. Using the Android App Drawer, locate the <br/>**FTC Driver Station** icon. Tap on the icon to launch the <br/>Driver Station app. | <img src="https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/WikiSupport/blob/master/ftc_app/images/PairingStep3.jpg" width="175"> |
| 4. Touch the three vertical dots on the upper right <br/>hand corner of the main screen of the FTC Driver Station <br/>app.  This will launch a pop-up menu. | <img src="https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/WikiSupport/blob/master/ftc_app/images/PairingStep4.jpg" width="175"> |
| 5. Select Settings from the pop-up menu. | <img src="https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/WikiSupport/blob/master/ftc_app/images/PairingStep5.jpg" width="175"> |
| 6. From the Settings screen, look for and select <br/>“Connect with Robot Controller” to launch the Connect <br/>with Robot Controller screen. | <img src="https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/WikiSupport/blob/master/ftc_app/images/PairingStep6.jpg" width="175"> |
| 7. Find the name of your Robot Controller from the <br/>list and select it.<br/><br/>After you have made your selection, use the back-arrow <br/>key to return to the Settings screen.<br/><br/>Then press the back-arrow key one more time to return <br/>to the main Driver Station screen. | <img src="https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/WikiSupport/blob/master/ftc_app/images/PairingStep7.jpg" width="175"> |
| 8. When the Driver Station returns to its main <br/>screen, the first time you attempt to connect to the <br/>Robot Controller a prompt should appear on the Robot <br/>Controller screen.<br/><br/>Click on the “ACCEPT” button to accept the connection <br/>request from the Driver Station. | <img src="https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/WikiSupport/blob/master/ftc_app/images/PairingStep8.jpg" width="175"> |
| 9. Verify that the Driver Station screen has <br/>changed and that it now indicates that it is connected <br/>to the Robot Controller.<br/><br/>The name of the Robot Controller’s remote network <br/>(“9999-C-RC” in this example) should be displayed in the <br/>Network field on the Driver Station. | <img src="https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/WikiSupport/blob/master/ftc_app/images/PairingStep9.jpg" width="175"> |
| 10. Verify that the Robot Controller screen has <br/>changed and that it now indicates that it is connected <br/>to the Driver Station.<br/><br/>The Network status should read “active, connected” on <br/>the Robot Controller’s main screen. | <img src="https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/WikiSupport/blob/master/ftc_app/images/PairingStep10.jpg" width="175"> |
