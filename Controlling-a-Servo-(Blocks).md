In the section titled [Writing an Op Mode with FTC Blocks](Writing-an-Op-Mode-with-FTC-Blocks) you learned how to use the FTC Blocks Programming Tool to write an op mode that controls a 12V DC motor.  In this section, you will learn how to write an op mode that controls a servo motor.

### What is a Servo Motor?
A servo motor is a special type of motor that is designed for precise motion.  A typical servo motor has a limited range of motion.

In the figure below, a “standard scale” 180-degree servo is shown.  This type of servo is popular with hobbyists and with FIRST Tech Challenge teams.  This servo motor can rotate its shaft through a range of 180 degrees.  Using an electronic module known as a servo controller you can write an op mode that will move a servo motor to a specific position.  Once the motor reaches this target position, it will hold the position, even if external forces are applied to the shaft of the servo.

Servo motors are useful when you want to do precise movements (for example, sweep an area with a sensor to look for a target or move the control surfaces on a remotely controlled airplane).

### Modifying Your Op Mode to Control a Servo
Let’s modify your op mode to add the logic required to control a servo motor.  For this example, you will use the buttons on the Logitech F310 gamepad to control the position of the servo motor. 

With a typical servo, you can specify a target position for the servo.  The servo will turn its motor shaft to move to the target position, and then maintain that position, even if moderate forces are applied to try and disturb its position.

For the blocks Program & Manage server, you can specify a target position that ranges from 0 to 1 for a servo.  A target position of 0 corresponds to zero degrees of rotation and a target position of 1 corresponds to 180 degrees of rotation for a typical servo motor.

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/WikiSupport/blob/master/ftc_app/images/servo0to80.jpg" width="300"><p>

In this example, you will use the colored buttons on the right side of the F310 controller to control the position of the servo.  Initially, the op mode will move the servo to the midway position (90 degrees of its 180-degree range).  Pushing the yellow “Y” button will move the servo to the zero-degree position.  Pushing the blue “X” button or the red “B” button will move the servo to the 90-degree position.  Pushing the green “A” button will move the servo to the 180-degree position.

Note that it will take an estimated 20 minutes to complete this task.

| 20. Click on the “Gamepad” category and select the “gamepad1.B” block. Drag the block so that it clicks in place as the second test condition of the logical “or” block.<br/><br/><p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/WikiSupport/blob/master/ftc_app/images/ControlServoStep20ControlHub.jpg" width="300"></p> |
| 21. Select a “set servoTest.Position to” block and place it into “do” clause of the first else-if block.<br/><br/><p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/WikiSupport/blob/master/ftc_app/images/ControlServoStep21ControlHub.jpg" width="300"></p> |
| 22. Highlight the number “0” and change it to “0.5”. With this change, if the user presses the “X” button or “B” button on gamepad #1, the op mode will move the servo to the midway (90-degree) position.<br/><br/><p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/WikiSupport/blob/master/ftc_app/images/ControlServoStep22ControlHub.jpg" width="300"></p> |
| 23. Use a “gamepad1.A” block as the test condition for the second “else if” block. Drag a “set servoTest.position to” block to the do clause of the second “else if” block and modify the numeric value so that the servo’s position will be set to a value of 1.<br/><br/><p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/WikiSupport/blob/master/ftc_app/images/ControlServoStep23ControlHub.jpg" width="300"></p>For this clause, if the “A” button is pressed on the #1 gamepad, the op mode will move the servo to the 180-degree position. |
| 24. Insert a “call telemetry.addData” block (numeric) before the “call Telemetry.update” block. Rename the key field to “Servo Position” and insert a “servoTest.Position” block for the number field.<br/><br/><p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/WikiSupport/blob/master/ftc_app/images/ControlServoStep24ControlHub.jpg" width="300"></p>This set of blocks will send the current servo position value to the Driver Station while the op mode is running. |
| 25. Save your op mode and verify that it was saved successfully to the Robot Controller.<br/><br/><p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/WikiSupport/blob/master/ftc_app/images/ControlServoStep25ControlHub.jpg" width="300"></p> |
| 26. Follow the procedure outlined in the section titled [Running Your Op Mode](https://github.com/ftctechnh/ftc_app/wiki/Running-Your-Op-Mode) to run your updated op mode. Also, make sure that your gamepad is designated as User #1 before running your op mode.<br/><br/><p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/WikiSupport/blob/master/ftc_app/images/ControlServoStep26ControlHub.jpg" width="350"></p>You should now be able to control the servo position with the colored buttons.  The servo position should be displayed on the Driver Station. |
