### Blocks Reference Manual
As you start to write more complicated op modes, you will need to use more features of the FIRST Tech Challenge software development kit (SDK).  Bruce Schafer of the Oregon Robotics Tournament & Outreach Program (ORTOP) created a useful reference document that describes the programming blocks that are available with the FTC Blocks Programming Tool:

### Sample Op Modes

The Blocks Programming Tool has several built-in example op modes that demonstrate how to do different tasks with the FIRST Tech Challenge control system.  As you create a new file, you can use the Sample dropdown list control to display a list of available sample op modes or templates:
