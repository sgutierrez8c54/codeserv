The FTC Control System can be programmed using the Java programming language.  There are two different programming tools that are available for FTC Teams.

1. **[OnBot Java](OnBot-Java-Tutorial)** -  With the OnBot Java tool, a user can create, edit and build _op modes_ through a Chrome web browser.
    * Advantages 
        - Easy to setup.
        - Only requires a Chrome browser to work (i.e., can be run on a Chromebook or a tablet).
        - Short op mode build times.
        - Source and binary files are stored on the Robot Controller.
    * Disadvantages 
        - The source code editor has limited features.
        - The auto-complete function is limited.
        - Not integrated with version control software (such as git).

2. **[Android Studio](Android-Studio-Tutorial)** -  Android Studio is the development tool that is recommended by Google to author Android apps.  Android Studio can be used to create, edit and build _op modes_ for an FTC robot.  However, Android Studio is only recommended for experienced programmers.  Inexperienced programmers should use the [Blocks programming tool](Blocks-Tutorial) instead.   

    * Advantages 
        - It has a very powerful integrated development tool.
        - It provides sophisticated auto-complete functionality.
        - It has built-in, advanced debugging and monitoring tools.
        - Is integrated with git (a version control software).
    * Disadvantages 
        - Requires advanced programming skills.
        - Requires an advanced knowledge of Java.
        - Requires a modern, high-performing development computer.
        - Can be very difficult for a novice to install, configure and maintain.

**Important Note:** Both Java programming tools require that the user have an in-depth understanding of the Java programming language.  If you are not an advanced Java programmer, then FIRST recommends that you consider using the [Blocks tool](Blocks-Tutorial) to program your robot.
